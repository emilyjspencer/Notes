# Agile development

Agile is one of several software development methodologies. Others include Waterfall, rapid application and DevOps

* Agile favours the idea of MVP - creating and delivering a minimum viable product; the smallest and simplest version of what is envisioned.
* The principal goal of MVP is to receive client feedback before releasing a fully-fledged product - feedback can be received much earlier on and then the product can be iterated on. 
* Features are built, feedback is collected, analysed and taken into consideration.
The benefits of taking an Agile approach might include:
 - reduction of risks;
 - makes the product more adaptable/extensible
 - less likely to result in loss of significant loss of capital
 - lower likelihood that time is wasted on unwanted features etc


### The Agile Manifesto 

The Agile Manifesto was created back in 2001 by Kent Beck, Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber.
It promotes the following values:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

The idea is with Agile, a framework can be built that that is agile/nimbled enough to adjust to changing demands
* With Agile, there is a tighter feedback loop between the developers, the business, the users and the customers - resulting in a faster product to market that is more durable, flexible, and competitive.
* The development cycle supports the ability to adapt to the challenges that we face


# Some defining features of Agile development

* Sprints -  Agile interactions.
* A sprint is usually roughly four to six weeks in length but some can be as short as a week.
* During a sprint, priorities are translated from business stakeholders into requirements 
These requirements determine when a task can be considered to have been completed, how long it will take and if it is dependent on other tasks or features
* Requirements are then minted into tickets, where progress is tracked and commented on. 
* The requirements are then transalted into tickets, where progress is tracked and commented on. 
* Once a sprint is coming to the end of its life, priorities are set for the next sprint to determine what each individual will work on.
* The sprint closes with a spring retrospective, to take stock of what went well and what could have gone better, providing an opportunity for feedback from team members.
* Scrum masters lead this and the other sprints
* Can be considered to be a blend of a project manager and a stakeholder ambassador


### Daily Stand ups

* Learn about what about others are working on
* Ask for help or advice if 'blocked'


# Use cases for Agile

Different software development methodologies lend themselves to different products e.g. 
The agile way or working is perhaps best when the product requires small and frequent updates and it needs to get to the market quickly.

In contrast, the Waterfall workflow might be considered better if the quality is more important - where the tolerance for bugs is low or non-existent.
- Defined by a focus on testing and ensuring that the product actually works

### Agile use case


A social media app 
Due to the fierce competition among various social media applications, businesses need to adapt and grow to meet their customers' needs
The most important thing there is that you’re catering to your customer base rather than ensuring that the app is working flawlessly
