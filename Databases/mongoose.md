# Mongoose

* Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB
which can be used to interact with a database, rather than using a query language
* It is similar to an ORM(Object-Relational Mapper) that would be used with a relational 
database like PostgreSQL.
* Both - ODMs and ORMs exist to make developers' lives easier by providing
built-in structure and methods 
* It represents the websiteâ€™s data as JavaScript objects, which are then mapped on to the underlying database
* It acts as a frontend to MongoDB and provides a straightforward and schema-based solution
to model application data 
* MongoDB and Mongoose are commonly used together because the document storage and 
query system looks very much like JSON 

**Mongoose schema and models**

* Each Mongoose schema maps to a specific MongoDB collection
* A 'collection' is akin to tables and rows in relational databases
* Model instances represent MongoDB documents, which can be saved and retrieved from the database
* Document creation and retrieval is handled by a model
